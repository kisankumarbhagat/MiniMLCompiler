# MiniMLCompiler

MiniMLCompiler is a lightweight machine learning compiler built using Python and ONNX. It takes a trained ONNX model as input, generates an Intermediate Representation (IR), performs optimization on the IR, and finally outputs human-readable pseudocode that represents the model architecture and flow.

## Features

-  Load and validate ONNX models  
-  Generate Intermediate Representation (IR)  
-  Optimize IR for computational efficiency  
-  Generate human-readable pseudocode  
-  Save output results in a structured format

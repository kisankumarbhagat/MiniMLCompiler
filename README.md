# MiniMLCompiler
A lightweight compiler for ONNX machine learning models that converts them into human-readable intermediate representations (IR), optimizes them for computational efficiency, and generates pseudocode explaining the model architecture. Ideal for model inspection, educational purposes, and understanding neural network internals.
